    4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays (hard) https://leetcode.com/problems/median-of-two-sorted-arrays/

    3. lengthOfLongestSubstring (medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/solution/
    solved naively with helper function to check substring for inclusion and return sliced substring if included (O(n^2 time))
    22 minutes

    a better solution uses a hash to keep track of seen chars and their index, using a moving i..j window
    i tried to implement better solution but had trouble updating window start point

    9. Palindrome Number (easy) https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number
    Solved as directed without converting to string by using a reverse digit helper function (building a reversed integer one number at a time).
    had to math.floor a division because it was automatically making float instead of integer division. Took less than 10 minutes. 90% fast
    O(n) time and space (must hit each digit of input and reverse)
