    3. lengthOfLongestSubstring (medium) https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/solution/
    solved naively with helper function to check substring for inclusion and return sliced substring if included (O(n^2 time))
    22 minutes

    a better solution uses a hash to keep track of seen chars and their index, using a moving i..j window
    i tried to implement better solution but had trouble updating window start point
